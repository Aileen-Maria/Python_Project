# Python Employee Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data from ABC Company. It includes:
- Preprocessing (Cleaning the dataset, correcting height values)
- Employee distribution by team and position
- Identifying predominant age groups
- Analyzing salary expenditures by teams and positions
- Finding correlations between age and salary

## Dataset Information
